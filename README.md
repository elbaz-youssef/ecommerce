üöÄ Technologies Used
This project is built with a powerful and modern front-end stack:

React: The core library for building the user interface, leveraging a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.

TypeScript: Enhances code quality and developer productivity by providing static type-checking throughout the application.

Vite: A next-generation frontend tooling that offers incredibly fast development server startup and hot module replacement (HMR), and an optimized build process.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development and ensures a consistent, custom design without writing traditional CSS.

React Hook Form: A performant, flexible, and extensible forms library for React, simplifying form management and validation.

ZOD: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library, used in conjunction with React Hook Form for robust data validation.

üöß Current Limitations & Future Enhancements
This project is continuously evolving. Currently, some features are static or planned for future development:

Static Cart Data: The shopping cart data is currently not persisted using local storage or a backend.

No Filter/Sorting: Product filtering and advanced sorting functionalities are not yet implemented.

Mock Checkout: The checkout process is a front-end mock-up and does not process real payments or orders.

Future plans to enhance Saraa Store include:

Full-fledged user authentication with persistent sessions.

Integration with a real backend API for dynamic product data, order processing, and user management.

Payment gateway integration for secure transactions.

Advanced search functionality and more robust filtering options.

User reviews and ratings system for products.

An administrative dashboard for managing products, orders, and users.
