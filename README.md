## üöß Current Limitations & Future Enhancements
This project is continuously evolving. Currently, some features are static or planned for future development:
- **Static Cart Data:** The shopping cart data is currently not persisted using local storage or a backend.
- **No Filter/Sorting:** Product filtering and advanced sorting functionalities are not yet implemented.
- **Mock Checkout:** The checkout process is a front-end mock-up and does not process real payments or orders.

Future plans to enhance Saraa Store include:
- Full-fledged user authentication with persistent sessions.
- Integration with a real backend API for dynamic product data, order processing, and user management.
- Payment gateway integration for secure transactions.
- Advanced search functionality and more robust filtering options.
- User reviews and ratings system for products.
- An administrative dashboard for managing products, orders, and users.
